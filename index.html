            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>What I lack in career accolades and higher education, I make up for in rich life experiences. My
                path has been nontraditional to say the least, with my 20's being a whirlwind of creative
                ambition and dead end jobs, dotted with occasional troublemaking. My background is in music and
                video, having made my first video at 8
                years
                old and my first song at 17. Though I still enjoy the arts, part of succeeding is knowing when to
                quit. I pursued my goals to a logical conclusion (moving to Los Angeles, brushing shoulders with big wigs until lockdowns came) and went on a cross-country and international
                sabbatical.</p>

            <h2>Holiday road and viva Mexico</h2>
            <p>In May of 2020 I left Los Angeles and began volunteering on farms across the US using a platform
                called Workaway. It pairs penny pinching and adventurous travelers with property and land owners
                who are looking for help on the cheap. Eventually, I decided to travel to Mexico and take the
                same approach, though with less of a focus on rural farms, instead opting to work at various
                hostels. Increasing lockdown restrictions saw me stuck in Mexico, and I ended up living there
                for nearly 2 years. Last October, my Dad ran into some health issues, so I moved to Texas to
                help him tend to his land. Between thinning tree stands and using a tractor to dig up roots, I toiled with JS docs and worked on my fundamentals.</p>

                <h2>Your way is my way</h2>
                <p>Unless part of my duties for you as a programmer include making lattes or freestyle rapping, it's unlikely that I'll
                    have an informed approach to the work I'm doing. While I spend almost all of my free
                    time learning to
                    program on my own, my entire conception of how to program will be filtered through a lense that
                    you, as my manager, establish. You can rest assured that any pre-existing systems and best
                    practices will be observed with 0 issue.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The softest skills</h2>
                <p>Besides a high school diploma, I boast a doctorate from The University of Hard Knocks. I've
                    experienced the failure that precedes growth. I've earned the humility that follows overzealous
                    ambition. I've brushed shoulders with people from all walks of life: from consummate professionals
                    who boast multiple Grammy awards, to off-grid UFO shamans living in
                    earthen domes, and many others in between. Collaboration, communication, and temperance are skills
                    that
                    can't be taught. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>No surprises</h2>
                <p>A more senior or credentialed employee might be able to use jargon or past successes to
                    drum up their skill set, and in doing so compromise the integrity of your systems. But, since I'm
                    still
                    learning, and because my resume could fairly be deemed "uncompetitive", there's
                    no space for me to misrepresent my skill set. You can rest assured that what you see is what
                    you get. </p>

            <h2>Personal interests</h2>
            <p>I still casually produce music in a variety of genres and dabble with Adobe Suite programs for
                visual media. I enjoy travel and hope to touch every continent in my lifetime. Besides
                programming and doing all manner of landscaping duties for my Dad, I enjoy weightlifting as well as
                reading about philosophy and spirituality. I hope that once I've established a career, I
                can start work on having a big family.</p>
