                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>What I lack in career accolades and higher education, I make up for in rich life experiences. My
                        path has been nontradtional to say the least, with my 20's being a whirlwind of creative
                        ambition and dead end jobs, dotted with occasional troublemaking. My background is in music and
                        video, having made my first video at 8
                        years
                        old and my first song at 17. Though I still enjoy the arts <i>(and can still kick a sick
                            freestyle on command)</i>, part of suceeding is knowing when to
                        quit. I pursued my goals to a logical conclusion and went on a cross-country and international
                        sabbatical.</p>

                    <h2>Holiday Road and Viva Mexico</h2>
                    <p>In May of 2020 I left Los Angeles and began volunteering on farms across the US using a platform
                        called Workaway. It pairs penny pinching and adventurous travelers with property and land owners
                        who are looking for help on the cheap. Eventually, I decided to travel to Mexico and take the
                        same approach, though with less of a focus on rural farms, instead opting to work at various
                        hostels. Increasing lockdown restrictions saw me stuck in Mexico, and I ended up living there
                        for nearly 2 years. Last October, my Dad ran into some health issues, so I moved to Texas to
                        help him tend to his land. Thanks to my parents generosity, I have considerable free time to
                        alter my
                        life
                        trajectory
                        by learning to code.</p>

                <h2>Your way is my way</h2>
                <p>Unless part of my duties for you as a programmer include making lattes, it's unlikely that I'll
                    have an informed approach to the work I'm doing. While I spend almost all of my free
                    time learning to
                    program on my own, my entire conception of how to program will be filtered through a lense that
                    you, as my manager, establish. You can rest assured that any pre-existing systems and best
                    practices will be observed with 0 issue.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The softest skills</h2>
                <p>Besides a high school diploma, I boast a doctorate from The University of Hard Knocks. I've
                    experienced the failure that precedes growth. I've earned the humility that follows overzealous
                    ambition. I've brushed shoulders with people from all walks of life:
                    consummate professionals who boast multiple Grammy awards, questionable characters with
                    multiple felonies, and off-grid farmers living in earthen domes. Collaboration, communication,
                    temperance, and discernment are skills that
                    simply can't be taught. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Prime of life</h2>
                <p>Though I've lived quite a bit in my 31 years by any measure, I'm still filled with a desire for
                    growth. In the event that I'm selected for a position, my learning will continue until I boast
                    true proficiency in everything that constitutes Full Stack Web Development in 2023. My goals lie
                    beyond cursory clock punching and getting by. If I'm in your team, then your team is one that
                    will experience growth and renewal. </p>

                    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                    <p>I still casually produce music in a variety of genres and dabble with Adobe Suite programs for
                        visual media. I enjoy travel and hope to touch every continent in my lifetime. Besides
                        programming and doing all manner of landscaping duties for my Dad, I enjoy weightlifting. I
                        enjoy reading about philosophy and spirituality. I hope that, once establishing a career, I
                        can begin plotting to have a big family.</p>
